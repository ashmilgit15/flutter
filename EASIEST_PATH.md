## PATH 1: Use GitHub Actions (No Flutter Install) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Time**: 5 minutes | **Effort**: Low | **Storage**: None

### Steps:
1. **Upload to GitHub**

2. **Let GitHub Build It**
   - Go to "Actions" tab
   - Click "Build APK"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes

3. **Download APK**

   - Use in portfolio

**Pros**: Fast, no installation, automatic
**Cons**: Needs GitHub account

## PATH 2: Install Flutter Locally
**Time**: 60 minutes | **Effort**: Medium | **Storage**: ~2 GB

### Steps:
1. **Download Flutter**
   ```
   https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   ```
   Download ZIP (~1 GB)

2. **Extract & Add to PATH**
   ```powershell
   # Extract to C:\flutter
   # Add C:\flutter\bin to Windows PATH
   ```

3. **Build**
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   cd "C:/Users/Ashmil P/Desktop/Flutter/habit_garden"
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

**Pros**: Full control, can modify app, build anytime

## ü§î Which Should I Choose?

### Choose **PATH 1** (GitHub Actions) if:

### Choose **PATH 2** (Local Flutter) if:
- ‚úÖ You want to customize the app
- ‚úÖ You'll do Flutter development
- ‚úÖ You want offline building
- ‚úÖ You have 2GB+ free space

## üìû Quick Help

### Already have Flutter installed somewhere?

# If found, add that path to your PATH variable
```

### Need fastest possible solution?
**PATH 1** - GitHub Actions. Done in 5 minutes!

### Want to learn Flutter development?

## üéØ My Recommendation

**RIGHT NOW for portfolio**: Use PATH 1 (GitHub Actions)
- Get APK in 5 minutes
- Add to portfolio today
- No installation hassle

**LATER for development**: Install PATH 2 (Local Flutter)
- When you want to customize
- When you have time to set up
- For learning Flutter

You can always do both! Start with PATH 1 now, install Flutter later.
