2. Click "New Repository"
3. Name it: `habit-garden`
4. Make it Public
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Your Project

```powershell
# In your habit_garden folder
cd "C:/Users/Ashmil P/Desktop/Flutter/habit_garden"

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Habit Garden app"

# Connect to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-garden.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Trigger the Build

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "Build APK" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

### 4. Download Your APK

1. After build completes, click on the workflow run

3. Done! âœ…

## Alternative: Direct Download Link

### Option A: GitHub Releases

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. Go to GitHub â†’ Releases
3. Find your release
4. APK will be attached
5. Copy download link for portfolio

### Option B: Use GitHub Actions Artifact Link

Get direct link from Actions artifacts:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-garden/actions
```

## Benefits of This Method

âœ… No Flutter installation needed
âœ… No Android SDK needed
âœ… Builds in 3-5 minutes
âœ… Always builds clean APK
âœ… Automatic with every code change
âœ… Free on GitHub

## If You Don't Have Git Installed

### Download Git
```
https://git-scm.com/download/win
```

Install with default settings, then restart PowerShell.

## Quick Alternative: Upload Manually

If you prefer not to use command line:

1. Create GitHub repo on website
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all files from `habit_garden` folder
4. Commit
5. Go to Actions tab
6. Run workflow
7. Download APK

## Troubleshooting

### "git not recognized"
Install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### "Build failed"
Check Actions logs for errors. Usually:
- Missing dependencies (already configured âœ“)
- Android version mismatch (already fixed âœ“)

### Can't push to GitHub
```powershell
# If authentication fails, use Personal Access Token
# GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
# Create token with 'repo' scope
# Use token as password when prompted
```

## Full Manual Alternative

If you want to avoid all of this:

1. **Get Flutter SDK** (~1 GB download)
   - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   
2. **Extract to C:\flutter**

3. **Add to PATH**
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Edit Path â†’ Add: `C:\flutter\bin`
   
4. **Restart PowerShell**

5. **Run**:
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   cd "C:/Users/Ashmil P/Desktop/Flutter/habit_garden"
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

**Time**: 30-60 minutes (including downloads)

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**For Portfolio RIGHT NOW**: Use GitHub Actions (5 min)
**For Future Development**: Install Flutter locally (60 min)

Choose what works for you! Both produce the exact same APK.
